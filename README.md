# Coffee-Shop-Info

## Overview 

### I have created a Coffee Shop database using MySQL. I inserted different orgins of coffee, price, and the name. With this information I was able to maniplualte data, selecting tables with statements and null values, create database design through techiniques of normalizations, relationships and contraints.
